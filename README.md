## 🚀 What I Do

- 💡 **Transform Data Into Insight**  
  From raw tables to dashboards, I extract, clean, and analyze data to tell compelling stories that drive business decisions.

- 🧠 **Build & Apply Machine Learning Models**  
  I work with Scikit-Learn and other ML frameworks to develop models that solve real-world problems—from predictive analytics to anomaly detection.

- 🤖 **Experiment with AI & Generative Tech**  
  I’m actively exploring large language models (LLMs), LangChain, and GenAI to automate documentation, enhance search, and power smarter interfaces.

- 🛠️ **Develop Reusable, Scalable Solutions**  
  Clean code, optimized queries, and modular design are non-negotiable in my work—because messy data shouldn’t mean messy code.
